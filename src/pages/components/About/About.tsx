        Grow is a free series of workshops dedicated to helping women learn the
        basics of web development. If you have little or no experience in
        coding, Grow provides a safe space for you to discover the opportunities
        in tech. Get a feel for it, see if you like it or not. Maybe even make a
        career out of it. Or walk away vowing never to touch code again — that’s
        totally okay too.
